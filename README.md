# Starry Knight

Starry Knight uses Newtonian physics to draw positions and velocities of stars.

Features:
* Add stars anywhere with whatever mass (and an initial velocity )
* Let stars draw traces behind them as they travel
* Download the current state as a JSON (and upload it to reconstruct the situation)
* Draw the stars' velocity vectors

The grid itself is implemented over a JS canvas.
It's an infinite stretchable geogebra-like-but-prettier maths grid.

Just sit down and watch stars floating around - accelerating and decelerating, going in orbits or escaping into outer space.
