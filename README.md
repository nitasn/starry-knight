# Starry Knight

Starry-knight uses Newtonian physics to calculate positions and velocities of stars.
escaping into outer space.

Features:
* Add stars anywhere with whatever mass (and an initial velocity )
* Let stars draw traces behind them as they travel
* Get the current state as JSON (and upload it to reconstruct the situation)
* Draw the stars' velocity vectors

The grid itself is implemented over a JS canvas.
It's an infinite stretchable pretty-much-copied-from-geogebra-but-prettier maths grid.

Just sit down and watch stars floating around - accelerating and decelerating, going in orbits, or escaping into outer space.
